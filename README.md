# TAW Boilerplate

Boiler plate for tailwind, alpine and webpack

## What is it

It's a simple boilerplate to get a basic html site setup with webpack, tailwindcss and alpinejs

## What's included

Not a pro but works for me.
- start and build commands (build NODE_ENV=production to minify tailwind)
- start enables watch mode for easy devving
